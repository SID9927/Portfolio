              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am a skilled full-stack web developer
              with practical experience gained through internships, academic
              projects, and independent initiatives. At{" "}
              <strong>Brainwave Matrix Solutions</strong>, I contributed to
              developing an <strong>AirBnB Landing Page</strong> with a
              responsive, modern interface and a <strong>Blog Platform</strong>{" "}
              featuring secure JWT-based authentication, dynamic CRUD
              operations, and MongoDB integration. My role involved creating
              RESTful APIs, designing efficient database schemas, securing
              backend systems, and building interactive frontends using
              React.js.

              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During my <strong>PG-DAC</strong> program
              at C-DAC, Mumbai, I led the frontend development of{" "}
              <strong>Farmer-Marketplace</strong>, a platform empowering farmers
              by eliminating middlemen. Built with Java, Spring Boot, ASP.NET
              Core, React.js, and MySQL, this project sharpened my technical,
              leadership, and collaboration skills.

              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Iâ€™m also dedicated to personal
              development, building small-scale projects to refine my
              understanding of cutting-edge technologies and best practices.
              With a strong foundation in creating secure, responsive, and
              scalable web applications, I aim to deliver impactful solutions
              aligned with client and business goals.
